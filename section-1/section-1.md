# Introduction to Data Analysis

## Different Types of Analysis

Data Analysis is another form of storytelling with 5 categories:

* **Descriptive:** Summarize past data.  For example, creating visualizations in Power BI that summarize sales data for the last quarter (e.g., total sales, average order value).
* **Diagnostic:** Explain past data. For example, analyzing sales data in Power BI to understand why sales dropped in a specific region (e.g., using filters and drill-downs to investigate).
* **Predictive:** Forecast future data. For example, building a forecasting model in Power BI to predict future sales based on historical trends.
* **Prescriptive:** Optimize future data. For example, using Power BI to identify optimal pricing strategies to maximize revenue (e.g., using what-if analysis).
* **Cognitive:** Learn from data. For example, integrating Power BI with Azure Cognitive Services to analyze customer feedback sentiment from text data.

## Roles In Data

* **Business Analyst:** Translates business needs into data requirements. Works closely with data analysts to ensure reports and dashboards meet business objectives.
* **Data Analyst:** The Power BI expert responsible for gathering, cleaning, transforming, modeling, and visualizing data to extract meaningful insights. Designs and develops reports and dashboards for business users.
* **Data Engineer:** Focuses on building and maintaining the data infrastructure that supports data analysis (databases, data warehouses, data pipelines).
* **Data Scientist:** Uses advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to build predictive models and uncover deeper insights from large datasets.
* **Database Administrator:** Manages and maintains databases, ensuring data integrity, availability, and security.

## Tasks of a Data Analyst

1. **Prepare:**
    * **Get data:** Connect to various data sources (Excel, databases, online services, etc.) using Power BI Desktop.
    * **Clean and transform:** Utilize Power Query Editor to profile, clean, and transform data (handle missing values, remove duplicates, change data types, shape data).
    * **Load:** Import the prepared data into the Power BI data model.

2. **Model:**
    * **Design:** Create a data model that accurately represents relationships between datasets (often using a star schema with fact and dimension tables).
    * **Relationships:** Define relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys to enable analysis across multiple tables.
    * **Calculations:** Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns, measures, and tables to derive new insights.

3. **Visualize:**
    * **Select visualizations:** Choose appropriate visualizations (charts, graphs, maps, etc.) to represent data and insights effectively.
    * **Customize visuals:** Format and customize visualizations to enhance readability and visual appeal.
    * **Interactivity:** Add interactive elements (slicers, filters, drill-downs) to allow users to explore data dynamically.

4. **Analyze:**
    * **Explore data:** Use visualizations and filters to identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
    * **Insights:** Draw conclusions and extract meaningful insights from data analysis.
    * **Storytelling:** Present findings in a clear and compelling way using dashboards and reports.

5. **Manage:**
    * **Datasets:** Manage datasets in the Power BI Service (schedule refreshes, configure credentials, monitor performance).
    * **Workspaces:** Create and manage workspaces for collaboration and content organization.
    * **Deployment:** Publish reports and dashboards to the Power BI Service, configure access permissions, and share content with stakeholders.

# Building Blocks of Power BI

## Semantic Models

* **Connected data:** Bringing data together from various sources into a unified model.
* **Transformations:** Cleaning and shaping data using Power Query.
* **Relationships:** Defining how different tables are related to each other.
* **Calculations:** Using DAX to add calculated columns, measures, and tables to enhance analysis.

## Visualizations

* **Variety:** Power BI offers a wide range of visualizations (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, maps, etc.) to suit different data types and analysis needs.
* **Interactivity:** Visualizations in Power BI are interactive, allowing users to filter, slice, and drill down into data for detailed exploration.
* **Customization:** Customize the appearance of visualizations to match branding or preferences.
